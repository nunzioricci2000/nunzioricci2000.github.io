    <h1>UserDefaults</h1>
    <h2>What UserDefaults do</h2>
    <p> Let’s say you create an application with some 
        settings you want to store. For example you 
        want to create a game that stores the high 
        score. That's where UserDefaults come in. </p>
    <p> UserDefaults provides a way to save files 
        with a pair of keys and values; keys are 
        Strings and values can be a variety of 
        types(see docs for more info). To access 
        this data you need an instance of UserDefaults, 
        in most cases you can use “standard” that is 
        a static property of UserDefaults already 
        defined in Foundation, creation of its instances 
        is a topic postponed to the next updates. </p>
    <h2>How to use them</h2>
    <p>UserDefaults are pretty easy to use. If you want
        to save a value you can use this code:</p>
    <code>
        <pre>
<span class="type">UserDefaults</span>.standard.set(value, forKey: "keyName")
        </pre>
    </code>
    <p>If you want to retrieve this value from the 
        storage, UserDefaults provide a variety of 
        methods to call depending on which type data 
        you want to get, for example let’s say that 
        the previous value is an integer, we can 
        retrieve it with:</p>
    <code>
        <pre>
value = UserDefaults.standard.integer(forKey: "keyName")
        </pre>
    </code>
    <p>And that's it. There is not much more to add on the
        topic UserDefaults are so easy to implement and I
        hope this helped.
    </p>
